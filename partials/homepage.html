It also provides a sense of security, granting access to healthcare, housing, and emergency funds. Moreover, money can be used to support charitable causes, create opportunities for others, and foster economic growth.

                <h1>GMO Food</h1>
                <img src="../img/article2.jpg" alt="gmo-food">
                <p>Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) food refers to crops or animals that have been genetically altered through biotechnology to possess specific desired traits. GMO food has been a subject of debate and controversy. Proponents argue that GMOs have the potential to increase crop yields, reduce pesticide use, and address food scarcity. They argue that GMOs can also enhance the nutritional content of food, making it more resistant to pests and diseases, and extend its shelf life. However, critics express concerns about potential environmental risks, health impacts, and ethical considerations associated with GMOs. They argue that long-term effects on biodiversity, ecological balance, and human health are not fully understood. Additionally, concerns about corporate control of seed supply and potential crossbreeding with non-GMO crops have been raised. Regulations and labeling requirements for GMO food vary worldwide. As the debate continues, GMO food remains a complex and evolving topic with various perspectives and considerations.</p>

                <img src="../img/article3.jpg" alt="money">
                <p>The view of the world in 2100 is a topic of speculation, as it is difficult to accurately predict the future. However, based on current trends and projections, the world in 2100 is expected to be vastly different from what it is today. With advancements in technology, there may be significant changes in various aspects of life, including communication, transportation, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. It is likely that the global population will continue to grow, putting increased pressure on resources and leading to changes in demographics, urbanization, and migration patterns. Climate change may have significant impacts on the planet, with potential consequences such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and shifts in ecosystems. However, there is also potential for positive advancements, such as renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and technological solutions to address global challenges. The world in 2100 may see unprecedented developments, both positive and negative, shaping the way we live, work, and interact on a global scale.</p>
